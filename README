1. DL And Install SDL2

Extracted the x86_64 SDL stuff to C:\Users\elbaz\AppData\Local\JetBrains\Toolbox\apps\CLion\ch-0\222.4345.21\bin\mingw\x86_64-w64-mingw32
which is the bundled mingw location, so may change on version

2. Added Glad lib to project

3. Added all the stuff in the CMake file to find SDL2 etc
